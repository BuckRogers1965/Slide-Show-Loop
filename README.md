# Slide-Show-Loop
A compact, heuristic tool that organizes a chaotic collection of images into a coherent, dreamy video loop.   It ignores filenames and metadata, instead sorting images based purely on raw pixel similarity. This create fluid, dream-like visual morphs that compress surprisingly well in video streams.
